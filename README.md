#Quiz Game Description

This Python-based quiz game utilizes locally stored question data to challenge users with a variety of trivia across different categories. Using object-oriented programming principles, the QuestionModel class structures each question and answer pair, while the QuizBrain class manages the game flow, tracking scores, and presenting questions interactively. 
Users engage by inputting answers, receiving immediate feedback on correctness, and viewing their final score upon completing the quiz.

Future imporvements for this project include developing a engaging UI and directly using the OpenTriviaDB API to access questions.
